My name is Milo Seagrave and my home's the seven seas,

I lead a band of pirates we're the mightiest of thieves,

With Fergus here at my side, we're true and brave and bold!

Until we got caught stealing from the kitchen cargo hold...

Boot Loot Bandit!

The greatest thieves the world had ever seen!

Boot Loot Bandit!

Through thick and thin we'll always be a team!

We washed up here on shore one day, not sure of where or when.

But we'll steal from the locals 'till we're pirates once again
